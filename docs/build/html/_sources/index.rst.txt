DFO-LS: Derivative-Free Optimizer for Least-Squares Minimization
================================================================

**Release:** |version|

**Date:** |today|

**Author:** `Lindon Roberts <lindon.roberts@sydney.edu.au>`_

DFO-LS is a flexible package for finding local solutions to nonlinear least-squares minimization problems (with optional constraints), without requiring any derivatives of the objective. DFO-LS stands for Derivative-Free Optimizer for Least-Squares.

That is, DFO-LS solves

.. math::

   \min_{x\in\mathbb{R}^n}  &\quad  f(x) := \sum_{i=1}^{m}r_{i}(x)^2 \\
   \text{s.t.} &\quad x \in C\\
               &\quad  a \leq x \leq b

The constraint set :math:`C` is the intersection of multiple convex sets provided as input by the user. All constraints are non-relaxable (i.e. DFO-LS will never ask to evaluate a point that is not feasible).

Full details of the DFO-LS algorithm are given in our papers:

DFO-LS is a more flexible version of `DFO-GN <https://github.com/numericalalgorithmsgroup/dfogn>`_.

If you are interested in solving general optimization problems (without a least-squares structure), you may wish to try `Py-BOBYQA <https://github.com/numericalalgorithmsgroup/pybobyqa>`_, which has many of the same features as DFO-LS.
